LINUX FILE SYSTEM BASICS:



Linux does almost everything through files. 
The majority of hardware, functions, ect. as well as applications,
are represented by a file and between files.

Processes communicate through files.


be aware of absolute vs relative paths on a machine for files.

file system:
everything starts at root.
The system has a definite hierarchy to be aware of, see here:

man hier


some important directories:


/etc		configuration files local to the machine
/proc		filesystem of processes
/dev		special device files
/bin		holds binaries for all users and links
/sbin		holds operating system configuration binaries
/lib		hold shared libraries between /bin and /sbin
/opt		holds optional applications
/tmp		holds temporary files

/home		user directory


LINUX FILE TYPES:

-		denotes regular file
d		denotes directory
b		denotes block device files
c		denotes character device files

note that directories will contain meta information on files/

you can search a directory for single entries or words.

ex:	ls -l | grep Documents

links	can be of both hard link, or symbolic/soft link types.
socket	communication channel for applications

man socket
man port
