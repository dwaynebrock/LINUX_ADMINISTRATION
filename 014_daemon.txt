LINUX DAEMONS:



Daemons are self-operating processes that perform tasks in Linux and 
Mac OS. Windows refers to Daemons as Windows Services.

Daemons run background service processes not controlled by the computer user.
Daemons are run through processes. Note that processes are tracable through
the Linux filesystem, especially /proc. Commands such as ps, top and htop allow for tracking active processes.

man ps	
man top
man htop
