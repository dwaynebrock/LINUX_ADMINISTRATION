PROCESS STATE, NICENESS AND PROCESS MONITORING:



every process looks t get cpu time to perform tasks.
The kernel schedules those tasks.

There are 4 process states in Linux:

1) runable
2) sleeping
3) zombie
4) stopped

use top and htop commands to check state.
niceness is a measure of resource use in consideration of other processes.
The niceness rating priority in relation to other processes can be altered.

man nice
man renice
