PROCESSES BASICS:



man top
man htop




All actions in Linux spawn a process to complete them.

All processes have an owner.

All processes have an address space that they can use.

The kernel tracks process ownership, address space, and resource use.

parts of a process:
1) kernel data structures
2) address space

PIS- a process identification number
processes are identified and can be sent signals through the PID.

Process 1 is init. It spawns other processes. Literally the initiator.

In the case of virtual machines there are 2 inits-
one for the original machine,
and one for the virtual machine.

processes have parent-child ownership
a process that spawns another is its parent.
If a parent process dies,
init becomes the parent of its former child processes.
