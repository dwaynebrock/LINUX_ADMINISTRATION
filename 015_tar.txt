FILE COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION:


man tar

tar is the main command for file compression.

sending an archive in tar format is a lot more efficient than sending files by
ftp as the number of files starts to scale up. FTP is fine in small
numbers, but you should switch to tar files as the number of files increases.

common arguments with tar
:
	tar -zcfv

		f- filename
		v- verbose
		c- create archive
		z- compress the archive

Be careful not to create tarbombs. When cloning files, do so from just
outside the directory or create a special directory for it.

extracting a tar file:
	use -x option of tar.

get to know the man tar entry well for using tar.
