PIPING AND REDIRECTION IN LINUX



Processes in Linux run on one of three channels. Those channels are:

1) standard input (STDIN:0)
2) standard output (STDOUT:1)
3) standard error (STDERR:2)

example of sending output to a file:
	echo "this should be in a file" > somefile.txt
	cat somefile.txt

note that this method overwrites whatever is already in a file. 
Appending to a file without destroying what's already there is 
	a different command. 

ex:
	echo "add line.2" >> somefile.txt
	cat somefile.txt

appends a line to the bottom of a preexisting file.

note that > filename.txt is a de facto deletion if the area in front of > is blank.


error output:
	error output is different.
	you have to specify if you want to put error output somewhere.
	


Piping is the sendong of the output of one command to the input of another.

	form:	output_command | input_command
	ex:	cat file1.txt | grep often
	  -where cat prints out a file
	  -and grep searches for the word "often" within it.
	  -and only when both are true, the results are printed.
